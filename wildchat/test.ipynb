      "Write a very long, elaborate, descriptive and detailed shooting script, including a background and dialogues, for a Modern Sitcom comic scene based on the following scenario: Two Palestinian-American women are traveling by city bus (give them names and describe them in detail). One of them has been having an urge to poop for a while until that point. She grows more and more desperate, fighting the urge persistently. Once she realizes that she won't make it in time to a restroom, she quietly informs the other woman of this. The other woman initially implores her to hold it in and the two of them get into a protracted discussion on the matter. The other woman relents relents after failing to find a solution, and tells the woman reluctantly to let nature take its course in her clothes if necessary. The woman who is desperate to poop eventually decides to relieve the pressure and voluntarily fills her pants with a full solid load to relieve the pressure in full view of the other woman while trying to remain concealed from anyone else (describe this in meticulous detail). The other woman reacts to the poop accident and the stench (describe this in meticulous detail). They attempt to remain undetected. Once they are alone, the other woman jokingly teases the woman who pooped, who takes it in stride (elaborate on this dialogue).\n",
